# Welcome

... to somewhere?

# My life

I initially wrote in C++ (and later C), but I've come to mostly replace those with Rust.
I still sometimes write code in C, but I usually avoid C++.

I really like programming embedded or "ancient" systems such as the Game Boy Advance (of which I've long wanted to make an emulator for).
I have dabbled multiple times in implementing the C standard library for Linux.
I also have limited experience in assembly (mostly legacy Arm but also x86).

# Projects

My favourite repositories are the projects that I am most fond of.
These include:

* [agbsum](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/agbsum/); a CLI tool for patching GBA image header checksums
* [Benoit](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/benoit/); a multithreaded Mandelbrot Set renderer
* [eAS](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/eas/); a Rust-written assembler for Arm
* [`identity_map`](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/identity_map/); Identity-based key-value map for Rust
* [Luma](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/luma/); an emulator for the GBA line of systems
* [Oct](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/oct/); a Rust crate for encoding and decoding binary streams
* [Pollex](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/pollex/); a Rust crate for handling Arm instructions
* [u8c](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/u8c/); a C library for Unicode-related facilities

I host my repositories on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/), [GitHub](https://github.com/bjoernager/), and [`mandelbrot.dk`](ssh://git@ssh.mandelbrot.dk) (SSH-only).
