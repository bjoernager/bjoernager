# Philosphy

I code because that is my purpose. My code is for the cause.

My repositories are hosted on [the Mandelbrot Set] and (in some cases) on
[Codeberg] and [GitLab] as well. 

[the Mandelbrot Set]: <https://mandelbrot.dk/bjoernager/>
[Codeberg]: <https://codeberg.org/bjoernager/>
[GitLab]: <https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/>

I do not take pull requests but I do take suggestions.

# Programming languages

My main programming language is [Rust] (btw.) For embedded programming, I use C
and assembly. For legacy programming, I use whatever was prominent at that time
(e.g. Turbo C++ for MS-DOS.)

# Music

I like music. I don't like bragging about specific music. Enjoy whatever.
