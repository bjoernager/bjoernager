# Welcome

# My life

I initially wrote in C++ (and later C), but I've come to mostly replace those with Rust.
I still sometimes write code in C, but I usually avoid C++.

I really like programming embedded or "ancient" systems such as the Game Boy Advance (of which I've long wanted to make an emulator for).
I have dabbled multiple times in implementing the C standard library for Linux.
I also have limited experience in assembly (mostly legacy Arm but also x86).

# Projects

My pinned repositories denote the projects that I am most fond of.
These include:

* [agbsum](https://mandelbrot.dk/agbsum/); a CLI tool for patching GBA image header checksums
* [Benoit](https://mandelbrot.dk/benoit/); a multithreaded Mandelbrot Set renderer
* [bZipper](https://mandelbrot.dk/bzipper/); a Rust crate for encoding and decoding binary streams
* [eAS](https://mandelbrot.dk/eas/); a Rust-written assembler for Arm
* [Luma](https://mandelbrot.dk/luma/); an emulator for the GBA line of systems
* [Pollex](https://mandelbrot.dk/pollex/); a Rust crate for handling Arm instructions
* [u8c](https://mandelbrot.dk/u8c/); a C library for Unicode-related facilities

I host my repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/bjoernager/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/bjoernager/), and [`mandelbrot.dk`](https://mandelbrot.dk/).  

[Dux](https://mandelbrot.dk/dux/) was my first library and intended for replacing other libraries such as GLFW and Winit.
The logo of this project was loosely based on that of u8c and currently serves as my profile picture.
